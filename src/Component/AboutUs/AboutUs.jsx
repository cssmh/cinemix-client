        A movie website serves as an online platform dedicated to providing
        information, entertainment, and resources related to films. Typically,
        such websites offer a wide range of content, including movie reviews,
        trailers, news, interviews, and articles about the film industry. Users
        can browse through various sections to discover new releases, upcoming
        films, and classic movies. They can also read reviews to gauge the
        reception of a particular film before deciding to watch it.
        Additionally, many movie websites provide features such as user ratings,
        allowing visitors to rate and discuss movies they've seen.
